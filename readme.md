# üîç Latent Inspector

#### = ü•Å Drum +  ü§ñ VAE
An interactive demo based on the latent vector to generate drum pattern. The player can modify any dimension in the latent vector to see how it affect the drum pattern through the decoder. Also, the latent vector will change responsively when the drum notes are added or removed.

Besides the idea of visualization, I am also developed this based on another thought. What musicians need may not be only a particular feature (like interpolation) of musical machine learning, or well-organized function, but also some unknown possibilities. As [David Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yadcdunOd7U) said, it would be much more interesting when the musician has no idea what the knobs are designed for on a synthesizer. Every dimension in the latent vector is similar to the knobs on a synthesizer, and it will produce some melodies/drum variation that might be interesting.
